S3 101 :
--------

    * Simple Storage Service
    * Provides developers with simple,durable and highly scalable object based storage.
    * S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amounts of data form anywhere on the web.
    

    * Founder of Dropbox started using S3.

    * S3 is a safe place to store your files.
    * It is an object based storage.
    * The data is spread across multiple devices and facitlites.

    * Objects are like videos, photos and PDF documents or word documents called as "Flat Files".
    * Designed to withstand failure.

    Basics:
    --------

    * S3 is object based i.e allows to store files.
    * Files size  0 - 5TB
    * Unlimited Storage
    * Files are stored in "buckets" (i.e folders)
    * S3 is a universal namespace,i/e names must be unique globally.
    * Creates a DNS addres such as https://s3-eu-west1-amazonaws.com/acloudguru
    * When you upload a file to S3, 200 code if successful.

    Data consistency in S3:
    ----------------------

        * Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects.
        * Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES(can take some time to propogate)
        * Updates to S3 are atomic.
    
    S3 is a simple key-value store:
    ------------------------------

        * S3 consists of Object based.
        Objects consist of the following.
            * Key (name of the object)
            * Value (data and is made of sequence of bytes.)
            * Version ID (Important for versioning)
            * Metadata (data about data your are storing.) When was the file first created.
            * Subresource
                ACL - Who can access this object. On individual buckets
                Torrent - BitTorrent protocol
            
            * 99.99% SLA.
            * 99.9% availability
            * 99.999999999% durability on S3 information. (11* 9's)
            * Tiered storage options
            * Lifecycle Management
            * Versioning
            * Encryption
            * Secure your data using ACL's adnd Bucket Policies.

    Different Storage tier's in S3:
    ------------------------------

        S3:
            * 99.99%  availability
            * 99.999999999% durability
            * Stored redudantly across multiple devices in multiple facilites.
            * Designed to sustain loss of 2 concurrent facilites.

        
        S3 - IA (Infrequently Accessed):
        -------------------------------
            * Example: Pay Slips
            * For data that is acessed infrequently but requires rapid access when needed.
            * Lower fee than S3 but retrieval fee is charged.
        
        Reduced Redudancy Storage
        -------------------------

            * Designed to provide 99.99% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year.
        
        Glacier:
        --------

            * Low cost storage service for data archival.
            * Stores data for as low as $0.01 and is optimized for data that is infrequently accessed.
            * Takes 3-5 hours for to retrieval data from Glacier.

        S3 Charges:
        -----------

            * Storage
            * Requests
            * Storage Management Pricing (adding tags to data to control costs)
            * Data transfer pricing. (Data in is free and data replication is charged.)
        
        Transfer Accelaration - 
        ----------------------

        * Fast,easy and secure Transfer of files over long distances between end users and s3 buckets.
        * Transfer Accelaration uses CloudFront globally distributed edge locations.
        * As data arrives at an edge location, it is routed to Amazon S3 over a an optimized network path.
