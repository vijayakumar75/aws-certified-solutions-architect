Cross-Region Replication:
-------------------------

* Versioning should be turned on for both S3 buckets
* When you update a particular version of the file, the whole versions of the files are copied to S3.
* Permissions also get replicated.
* Only new objects that are added, are replicated to the destination buckets.
* When you edit/delete objects over cross Region Replication, its gets edited/deleted in the destination bucket.
* If Delete Marker is deleted in source, its doesn't get replicated in destination.
