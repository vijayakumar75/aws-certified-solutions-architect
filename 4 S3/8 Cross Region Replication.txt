Cross Region Replication:
=========================

* In order to enable Cross Region Replication, versioning needs to be turned on for both buckets.
* Only new objects that are added, are replicated to the destination buckets.
* Existing buckets are not replicated.
* When we delete a delete marker, it is not replicated.
* When we delete version, they are not deleted on the destination bucket.


* Versioning must be enabled both source and destination buckets.
* Regions must be unique.
* Fiels in an existing bucket are not replicated automatically.
* All subsequent updated are replicated automatically.
* You cannot replicate multiple buckets or daisy chaining.
* Delete markers are replicated.
* Deleting individual versions  or delete markers will not be replicated.
* Understand Cross-Region replication is high level.
