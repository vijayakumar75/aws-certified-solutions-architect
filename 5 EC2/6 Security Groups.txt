Security Groups:
=================

    * Virtual Firewall.
    * Control traffic to instances.
    * 1 instance can have multiple security groups.

    * Connect to SSH


    sudo su
    service httpd start
    yum update -y
    yum install httpd -y

	--------------------
     chkconfig httpd on - To autostart apache on boot
    -------------------


     clear

     cd /var/www/html
     * nano index.html
    
    <html><h1>Hello Cloud Guru's </h1></html>


     * Any rule that we apply to Security groups applies immediately.
     * Security groups are stateful.
     * When we add Inbound rule, outbound rule are added.


     Outbound Rules:
     ===============

    * All Traffic
    * Custom 0.0.0.0/0  


    All = Default Security Group    


    Combines multiple security Group to  add all ports.
    Outbound rules don't matter whether you have inbound rules or not.



Security Groups Lab:
==================

* All inbound traffic is blocked by Default.
* All outbound traffic is allowed.
* Changes to security group take effect immediately.
* Any no of EC2 insances in a security Group.
* Multiple security group attached to a single ec2 instance.
* Security groups are stateful.
* If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic, in that traffic is automatically allowed back out again.
* Cannot block specific IP address using Security Groups
------------------------------------------------------
* Only Allow Traffic, Cannot deny traffic or IP address.
-------------------------------------------------------

* Instead use Network Access control lists.
------------------------------------------------
* You can specify allow rules but not deny rules.
