Summary:
==========

Know differences between

    On Demand
    Spot
    Reserved 
    Dedicated Hosts


EBS Types:

    General Purposed(GP2) 10,000
    Provisioned IOPS (IO1) more than 10,000
    Throughput optmizied (ST1) - Frequently accessed workloads - not bootable
    Cold HDD (SC1)- Less Frequently accessed workloads - not bootable 
    Magnetic HDD - cheap, infrequently accessed workloads.


You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple Ec2 instances, instead use EFS.

* Termination Protection is turned by off
* EBS backed instances are deleted when the ec2 instance is terminated.
    Root Volumes cannot be encrypted by default.


    * Volumes exist in EBS
    * Virtual Hard Disk
    * Snapshot exists in S3 and are point in time copies of Volumes
    * Snapshot are incremental.
    * First Snaphost,, takes some time to create

    * Snaphosts of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
    * Volumes restored from encrypted snapshots are encrypted.
    * You can share snapshots, but only if they are unencrypted.
    * Can be shared with ohter AWS accounts.


    To create a snapshot for EBS that serve as root, we must stop the instance before taking a snapshot.


    * Instance store volumes are called as Ephemeral Storage.
    * Instance store volumes cannot be stopped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose data.
    * EBS backed instances can be stopped. YOu will not lose data of this instance if stopped.
    * Both can be rebooted.
    *By Default,root volumes are deleted on termination. with EBS we can tell ec2 instance to keep the root device volume.


    How to take a snapshot of an RAID array?
    ========================================

    Stop the app from writing to disk.
    Flush all caches to the disk.

    How can we do this?
        - Freeze the FS.
        - unmount the raid array.
        - Shutting down associated Ec2 instance.


    AMI's are regional.
    YOu can launch an AMI only from the region it is stored.
    Copy AMI's to other regions using console, CLI or EC2 API.



    Cloudwatch:
    ============

    standard Monitoring  = 5 minutes
    Detailed Monitoring = 1 minutes.

    Cloudwatch is for performance Monitoring.
    CloudTrail is for auditing.


    Dashboards:
    -----------

        - Create Dashboards for monitoring the AWS Environment.
        - Create alarams for thresholds.
        - Events
        - Logs _ Helps to aggrgate ,monitor and store logs.
        
        
    Roles
         - More secure that storing your access and secret KEY on individual instances
         - Easier to Manage
         - Roles can be assigned to a Ec2 instance after it has been Provisioned.
         - Roles are universal.

    EFS Features:
    =============

    - NFSv4
    - Pay for storage which you use.
    - 30 cents / GB
    - Can support multiple concurrent connections.
    - Data is stored in multiple AZ's within a region.
    - Read after write consistency.


    Lambda:
    =========

    Upload the code and lambda manages the infrastructure.

    - Event Driven Compute Service.
    - Compute Service response to HTTP Requests.
