Elastic Block Storage;
===================

    * Create and attach storage volumes to Ec2 Instances.
    * Create a file system on top of it or install a DB or use it like any other block storage.

    * EBS are placed in a specific AZ where they are automatically replicated to save from failure of a single component.


    EBS Types:
    ==========

   *   General Purpose SSD (GP2):
       =========================

     * Balance both price and performance.
     * 3 IOPS/GB with 10,000 IOPS and the ability to burst upto 33,000 IOPS for extended periods of time  for volumes of 3334 GB and above.



   * Provisioned IOPS SSD(IO1):
     ==========================

     Designed for large I/0 instensive apps such as NoSQL DB's
     Use when more than 10,000 IOPS are needed.
     Can Provision about 20,000 IOPS per volume.

   *  Throughput optimized HDD (ST1):
     ==============================

        * Sequential writes
        * Big Data
        * Data Warehouses
        * Log processing.
        * Cannot be a boot volume.

   * cold HDD:
   ===========

  * Lowest cost storage for infrequently accessed workloads.
  * File Server
  * Cannot be a boot volume.


  Magentic (standard):
  ====================

  * Lowest EBS volume that is bootable.
  * Data is accessed infrequently and apps where lowest cost is important.


  Types of EB:
  ===========
  General Purpose SSD(GP2)
  Provisioned IOPS (IO1)
  Throughput optimized HDD(ST1)
  Cold HDD 

  What we will cover:
  ===================

  Launch an Ec2 instance.
  Security Group Basics
  Volumes and Snapshots
  Create an AMI
  Load balancers and health checks.
  CloudWatch
  AWS command line:
  IAM roles with Ec2
  Bootstrap scripts
  Launch Configuration groups
  Autoscaling 101
  EFS
  Lambda Concepts
  Build a serverless webpage using Lambda and API Gateway.
  Build a serverless website with polly.
  Build an alexa skill to help you study.


  Exam Tips Ec2:
  =============

  On Demand
  Reserved
  Spot 
  Dedicated hosts
  Remeber with spot instances that if you terminate that instance, you still have to pay for that hour.

  If AWS terminates the spot instances, you get that hour usage of spot instances for free. 



  EBS consists:
  =============

  SSD General purpose - 10,000 IOPS
  SSD, Provisioned ( More than 10,000 IOPS)
  HDD, Throughput optimized - ST1 - Frequently accessed workloads
  HDD , Cold = Less Frequently accessed. Both not bootable. File serverless
  HDD , Magnetic - very cheap Bootable  storage, infrequently accessed storage.


  You cannot mount 1 EBS volume to multiple EC2 instance, instead use EFS.
