Upgrading EBS Volume Types:
===========================

EBS Lab:
========


* All EBS volumes should be in the same availability Zones
* How to find root volumes is by snapshots
* Snapshot is simply an amazon machine image (AMI).
* No Downtime when upgrading EBS volumes.
* Standard is pure magentic. Cannot modify volumes.
* Magnetic volumes cannot be modifed.


***********************************************************************************
* To move an  EC2 instance and EBS volume from 1 AZ to another,

	* Create a snapshot of the volume.
	* Copy the snapshot to the new Region by creating an AMI Image.
	* Can now move it to separate AZ or Regions.
	* Create an image of the snapshot and will be able 2 boot the volume.

**********************************************************************************

Boot it as a new EC2 instance:
=============================


* Snapshot is just a way to create backups.
* By default, Root volumes are terminated.

Recap:
=====

* Volume is just a virtual hard disk
* Snapshots exists on S3.
* Snapshots are just point in time of volumes.
* Snapshots are incremental - blocks that are changed since last snapshot are moved to S3.
* If first snapshot, it can take some time.
* For root EBS volumes, we must stop the EC2 instance and then take the snapshot
* While instance is running we can take snapshot.
* You can create an AMI for both Volume and snapshots.
* Change EBS volumes size on the fly including storage types and size.
* Volumes will be in the same AZ as the EC2 instance
* To move an EC2 Volume from one AZ/Region, we need to create an snap or image of it, and then move it to the new AZ/Region.


Security:
=========

* Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
* Volumes restored from encrypted volumes are encrypted automatically.
* Share snapshots only when they are unencrypted.
* Snapshots can be shared with other aws account.
