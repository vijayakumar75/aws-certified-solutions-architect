Elastic Compute Cloud: (EC2)
=======================

 * web service that provides resizable compute capacity on the cloud.
 * Reduces time to boot servers allowing you to quickly scale up and down.
 * Pay only for the capacity that was acutally used.
 * provides developers the tools required to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failures.



 EC2 Pricing Models:
 ==================

 * On Demand
 * Reserved
 * Spot
 * Dedicated Hosts

 On Demand:
 ----------
    Pay by the hour (In Exam)
    Allow you to pay a fixed rate by hour/second with no commitment.


Reserved:
-----------
    Contract Based, pay upfront for commiment
    Discount on hourly  rates.
    High capacity reservation, with significant discount on hourly charge for a instance.

Spot:
----
    Bid for capacity which you want. Greater savings.
    Enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing even greater savings if apps have flexible start and end time.


Dedicated hosts:
==============

* Physical EC2 instance Dedicated for your use.
* Reduce costs by allowing you to use existing server-bound software licenses.


on Demand:
---------

    * Low costs
    * Flexibility of EC2
    * No upfront charges or long - term commitment.
    * short-term or unpredictable workloads
    * Apps developed in EC2 for the first time.


Reserved:
========

* Steady state or predictable usage
* Apps that need reserved capacity
* Users able to make upfront payments to reduce their total computing costs.
* Standard RI's (75% discount on demand)
* Convertible RI's (54% discount on demand)
* Scheduled RI's - time window within you reserve.


Spot:
=====

* Apps with flexible start and end times.
* Apps that are feasible only at very low compute prices.
* Urgent computing needs with large amount of additional capacity.


Dedicated Hosts:
===============

* Dedicated EC2 server for your use.
* useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virualization.
* Great for licensing which does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments.
* Can be purchased on demand(hourly)
* Can be purchased as reservation for upto 70% off the on demand price.


Ec2 Instance Family Types: (10)
==========================


R4 - Memory Optimized  -> memory intensive apps/DB's 
M4 - General Purpose - Application servers
C4 = Compute Optimized - CPU intensive APps/DB's
D2 - Dense Storage - File Storage, data warehousing/Hadoop
G2 = Graphics Intensive = Video Encoding  and 3D  Application Streaming
I2 = High Speed storage = No SQL DB's / Data warehousing
T2 = Lowest cost, General Purpose = Webservers/ small DB's
P2 = Graphics/ Genral purpose GPU = Machine Learning, bitcoin Mining Etc.
X1 = memory Optimized = SAP HANA, Apache Spark etc.
F1 = Field Programmable Gate Array = Hardware accelaration for your code.
