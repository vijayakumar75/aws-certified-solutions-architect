        * Root account has complete admin access 
        * New users have no permissions when created first.
        * New users ares assigned access keys ID's and secret keys
        * Access keys are not similar to password.
        * You cannot log into the aws console using access keys.
        * You can use it to thorugh API's and CLI's.
        * You can view those keys only once. If we lose them, we have to regenerate the the same.
